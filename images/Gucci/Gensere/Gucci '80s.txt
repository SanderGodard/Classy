PRODUCT DETAILS
The Fall Winter 2018 runway show space reflected the stark environment of an operating room, emulating the theme of the collection where reconstructing materials and fabrics created a new identity. The collection is an ode to various cultural references—one being the '80s, which was the influence behind this colorful terry cloth patch.
