PRODUCT DETAILS
A trademark House code since it first appeared in the 50's, the green and red Web stripe pays homage to the equestrian world and, for the Fall Winter 2017 collection, is repurposed with a contemporary edge. Here, the archival motif runs along the sides of the wool mohair cropped pant completed by a sportswear-inspired elastic waistband with drawstring.
